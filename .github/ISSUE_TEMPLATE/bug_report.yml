        Finally, remember that the WiX Toolset is an Open Source project. Unless you are [paying for support](https://www.firegiant.com/services/support-programs/), everyone here is a volunteer and working because they want to, not because they have to. It also means that you have full access to the source code to help yourself and, in turn, help us improve the WiX Toolset.

        Reminder: if you want to ask a question, [start with Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wixtoolset/discussions/new?category=questions).
