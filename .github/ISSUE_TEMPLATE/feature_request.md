## Triage

Issues are triaged at [online meetings](https://www.firegiant.com/blog/), generally held alternate Tuesdays at 9:30 a.m. Pacific time (UTC-7/UTC-8). Meeting requests are posted in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wixtoolset/discussions/categories/announcements).

## Discussions and support

Note that discussions are best held in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wixtoolset/discussions/new?category=questions). Please do not open issues requesting support or debugging help; first start a thread in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wixtoolset/discussions/new?category=questions) and open an issue if the discussion suggests a bug in the WiX Toolset or that a feature request is appropriate.

## Instructions

Read the sections above. Delete the Triage, Discussions and support, and Instructions sections and fill out the rest.

## Feature requests

If this issue is a feature request:

* Describe the scenario and benefits that the feature supports.

> (Provide lots of specific detail so we understand the context around the feature.)

* Describe how you're accomplishing the feature today (if possible).

> (Be as specific as you can and err on the side of providing too much information.)

* Describe what you'd like the new feature to do.

> (There's no need to design it but suggestions are appreciated.)
