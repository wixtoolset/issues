## Triage

Issues are triaged at [online meetings](https://www.firegiant.com/blog/), generally held alternate Tuesdays at 9:30 a.m. Pacific time (UTC-7/UTC-8). Meeting requests are posted in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wixtoolset/discussions/categories/announcements).

## Discussions and support

Note that discussions are best held in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wixtoolset/discussions/new?category=questions). Please do not open issues requesting support or debugging help; first start a thread in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wixtoolset/discussions/new?category=questions) and open an issue if the discussion suggests a bug in the WiX Toolset or that a feature request is appropriate.
